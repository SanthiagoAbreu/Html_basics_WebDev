    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Luana Cano, and I'm a computer science student from Brazil. I am fluent in three languages, Portuguese being my native one, English, and Spanish.
         Recently I have rediscovered my love for the creative work that goes into cinematography, and I'm particularly gravitated towards the art directing job.
        For me, success is achieved in every new learned thing; it can be a new skill acquired or just being able to get throughout the day. I live by the principle 
        that love gives us the strength to be good to other people.</p>
