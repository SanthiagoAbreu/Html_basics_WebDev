    <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>
    White space in HTML documents is managed precisely using <br> and <p> tags. 
        The <p> tag defines a paragraph, creating a distinct block of text with a default 
            amount of vertical spacing both before and after it, effectively separating 
            content into readable chunks. For instance, <p>This is the first paragraph.
            </p><p>This is the second paragraph.</p> would render with a noticeable blank line 
            between the two sentences. In contrast, the <br> tag inserts a single line break, 
            forcing the subsequent content onto the next line without creating the larger block-level spacing of a paragraph.
    <p>This paragraph has      multiple      spaces between words.</p>
